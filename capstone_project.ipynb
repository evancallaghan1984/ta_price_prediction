    "# Forecasting Future Price Using Technical Analysis, Price Action, and Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "Warren Buffet is one of, if not the, greatest investor of all time. Anyone who has purchased, withheld from, or attempted to day-trade a particular stock with the undeniable self-certainty of its' impending movement knows how devastatingly unforgiving and unpredictable market forces can be. Studies show that [more than 97% of day traders are unsuccessful and lose money over time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423101), with just 1.1% of traders earning more than minimum wage and only 0.5% of traders exceeding the salary of entry level job. Even highly intelligent fund managers equiped with a wealth of valuable data and resources struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500. In fact, only [15% of funds in the IA North American sector were able to beat it over the last 10 years.](https://portfolio-adviser.com/the-15-of-us-funds-that-beat-the-sp-500-over-the-past-decade/) \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the statistically large number of failed traders and underperformers, it lends even more credit to the exceptional success of Buffet's career. How is it that he able to consistantly and reliably outsmart the [unfathomable randomness of Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and predict the direction of his stocks with enough accuracy as to outperform the vast majority of the investment world year over year. If not for the comprehensive investment philosphy and thoroughly described research methods outlined in the letters he sends to shareholderes of Berkshire Hathaway every year, his ability to predict the future would almost seem supernatural. Barring undisclosed superpowers, we can safely assume Buffet has simply built his own highly effective price prediction model using a carefully selected basket of features encompassing historical price action, technical analysis, financial metrics, market sentiment, economic data, human psychology, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we may not possess as much knowledge or experience as the worlds greatest investor, we can begin constructing a model to predict future price by experimenting with features utilized by accomplished long term investors, profitable traders in both intra-day and swing trading, and data-driven quantitative analysts. Technical Analysis (TA) indicators, which are lauded by day traders and can often be found integrated into the trading strategies of a variety investment professionals, are statistical tools used to analyze market trends, aid in decision making, and forecast probabilistic movements. Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are examples of commonly used TA indicators which are calculated using price or volume or both. These tools are 'lagging indicators', meaning they rely on historical data to generate signals and are reflective past price movements and trends, rather than predicting future price action. We use them to find levels of support and resistance, historically repeated patterns, and confirmation signals to enhance our other trades. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to begin the process of building a system of algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning, we will calculcate commonly used TA indicators and use them to predict stock price 1 week (5 trading days) in the future. This will give us a great baseline to see how useful analyzing TA indicators are to future price prediction, and which TA indicators are most correlated with future price. "

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "The target of our predictive model is daily closing price('Close'), which will be pulled from the 'yfinance' python library, along with daily open price('Open'), daily high price ('Daily_High'), daily low price ('Daily_Low'), and daily volume ('Volume'). In order to give the model enough information to find patterns, we will use about 10 years of trading data from 2015-01-01 to 2025-03-05. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before pulling the data, we use a CSV file downloaded from nasdaq.com which contains a list of the top 5000 stocks by market cap. Because of the limited computational power we have, we will only be using the top 25 stocks by marketcap. Once we import that CSV file, we will filter out all stocks which aren't common shares and remove any ticker names that are not available on Yahoo Finance. Upon doing this, we can pull in the 10 years of data from Yahoo Finance using our top 25 stock tickers by market cap and organize them into a dataframe for data manipulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our top 25 stocks in a dataframe, each containing 10 years of daily price data, we'll begin calculating our TA indicators using the daily closing price. Below is a list of the TA indicators we will be calculating and including in our model:\n",
    "* Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n",
    "  * An average of past prices over a set period of time, smoothing out price fluctuations.\n",
    "* Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\n",
    "  * A weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent prices for faster trend detection.\n",
    "* Relative Strengh Index (RSI)\n",
    "  * A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought and oversold conditions. \n",
    "* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)\n",
    "  * A trend-following indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages to signal potential buy/sell opportunities.\n",
    "* Stochastic Oscillator\n",
    "  * A momentum indicator comparing a securitiy's closing price to its' price range over a given period to gauge trend strength. \n",
    "* Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)\n",
    "  * A benchmark indicator that calculates the average price of a security based on both price and volume.\n",
    "* Bollinger Bands\n",
    "  * A volatility indicator that consists of a moving average with upper and lower bands expanding or contracting based on market volatility. \n",
    "* Average True Range (ATR)\n",
    "  * A measure of market volatility that tracks the average range between high and low prices over a set period. \n",
    "* On-Balance Volume (OBV)\n",
    "  * A volume-based momentum indicator that adds or subtracts volume based on price movements to assess buying and selling pressure.\n",
    "* Fibonacci Levels\n",
    "  * Key price levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence, used to identify potential support and resistance zones. \n",
    "* Momentum\n",
    "  * A trend indicator that measures the speed of price movement to identify the strength of a trend.\n",
    "* Quantiles\n",
    "  * Statistical thresholds that divide the dataset into equal parts including the median, upper quantile, and lower quantile.\n",
    " \n",
    "On top of this, moving averages will be calculated for all of these indicators and the daily price action that we pulled from yfinance (daily open price, daily high price, daily low price, and daily volume) with the exception of our target varaible (daily closing price). Each of these will get a 3day, 5day, and 7day moving average that will be used as an individual feature. In addition to the moving averages, the top 35 features most important to predicting the target variable will be getting 'lags', which basically give the model access to recent data. Since the model will only be looking at one row at a time, we need lags in order to give the model access to what the feature values were yesterday, the day before that, etc. The top 35 most important features will receive the following lags: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Once these lags are calculated, we will then find the most important features and filter by the top 60. After this, we will complete our preprocessed data by including 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-day lags for our target variable (daily closing price). We need to do this in order to give our model access to what the previous daily closing prices were in order to enhance our predictive capability. On top of this, we made sure to only include data that would be available to a person trading with the same information. "

    "### Filter Important Features to Lag\n",
    "With 10 years of historical data, 12 TA indicators, and 3 moving averages for all features, the number of features can add up fast and too many features will add unnecessary noise to our model. In order to filter our features down to a reasonable number, we use the baseline version of our model in order to get a list of the top 35 features. These top 35 features will have lags added to them. Each feature will day 1day, 2day, 3day, 4day, and 5day lags, which are different from moving averages because they are just the feature shifted back 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days, as a way to give the model recent data. Once we add lags to the top 35 features, we add the lagged features to our DataFrame and then run it through the same baseline model again to get feature importance. This time, we filter by top 60 and only keep the top 60 features. We then add lags for our target variable ('Close'), which leaves us with 60 filtered important features, 2 descriptive columns ('Date', and 'Symbol'), our target variable, and the lags for our target variable, which leaves us with 68 total columns in our DataFrame. This is the finalized preprocesssed DataFrame we will use to train and test our model with. "

    "The model we will be using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm based on gradient boosting and is optimized for speed and performance. It's great for structured data because of it's ability to handle missing values, prevent overfitting through regularlization, process large datasets, and handle unscaled data. XGBoost is used often in time series stock analysis for its' ability to capture complex patterns and identify nonlinear dependencies and interactions between features. This is especially useful since stock prices are influenced by a large number of factors. \n",
    "Below are some scientific and academic research papers on the usefulness of XGBoost for capturing complex patterns in time series data:\n",

    "\n",
    "Our XGBoost model is structured specifically for time series analysis. Instead of using the normal 'train_test_split', we manually split our data into training and testing sets, as 'train_test_split' would have randomly split data off for training and that would not work for temporal data. Our training data is all data for each stock from 2015-01-01 up to 2023-01-24 and all testing data is about the last two years of our data, from 2023-01-31 to the end of our data (2025-03-05). A copy of our target , 'Close', is copied and shifted back 5 trading days, so that the model can train on the value it is trying to predict with the feature values 5 trading days before. A default set of hyperparameters is used to create the model and upon fitting the model, performance metrics and a list of the top most important features are then printed out for evaluation. \n",
    "\n",

    "  * R-Squared\n",
    "    * Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent (target) variable that is explained by the model. It is on a scale of 0-1 and the closer the value is to 1, the better performing the model is. \n",
    "  * Mean Squared Error\n",
    "    * Measures the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Larger values mean higher prediction errors. Sensitive to large values and can show if the model has high outliers. The lower the value, the better. \n",
    "  *  Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "     * Calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Useful because it is in the same units as our model, giving us a realistic typical error size that our model is off by. The lower the value, the better.\n",
    "  *  Root Mean Squared Error\n",
    "     * Like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error is useful for evaluation because the value is in the same units as our predicted values. It differs because it is the square root of the average of the squared differences in predicted and actual values, which penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors. This metric is sensitive to large values and can show if outliers are distorting the model. The lower the value, the better.\n",
    "  *  Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)\n",

However, the lack of feature diversity in the current model should be addressed first. With only two features contributing the vast majority of the model's predictions (55% and 22%, respectively), it’s important to ensure that the model isn’t overly reliant on just a few features. To increase feature diversity, I decided to adjust the 'colsample_bytree' hyperparameter from 1 to 0.5. 'colsample_bytree' controls the fraction of features to be randomly sampled for each tree during the model's training process. By changing 'colsample_bytree' from 1 to 0.5, a random subset of features  (50% each subset) will be sampled for each tree during the model's training process. This should increase feature diversity and improve generalization, while maintaining relativley similar performance metrics. \n",

    "Let's first compare our feature diversity, which was the goal is changing colsample_bytree from 1 to 0.5 in model 2. As we can see, we were successful in increasing feature performance. Daily_Low dropped from 53.75% to 33.13%, and we now have two extra features over 5%. Before we solidify this as a success, let's compare our performance metrics. The most important metrics to us in this scenario are aboslute metrics. We are more concerned with how close the model's predictions are to the true value, regardless of a few large prediction errors, rather than working to minimize large prediction errors. Although squared metrics can be useful in some cases, absolute metrics are more interpretable, treat all errors equally, and give us an accurate representation of how far our predictions are off on average. Model 2 performed best with all of our absolute metrics: MAPE, Mean Absolute Value, and Median Absolute Value. For the squared metrics, model 1 technically had better values, but most of them were insignificant. Since model 2 positivley increased feature diversity and absolute performance metrics improved, model 2 is a better performer and we are going to solidfy the hyperparameter 'colsample_bytree' as 0.5 moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next hyperparameter we are going to adjust is 'max_depth', which controls the maximum depth of a decision tree. It helps determine how many levels a tree can grow before stopping. A larger 'max_depth' allows the tree to keep splitting until it fully classifies the data, potentially leading to overfitting. A smaller 'max_depth' limits how many splits can be made, forcing the tree to generalize more, but could lead to underfitting the data. Our default 'max_depth' is 5 and we are going to try 'max_depth' values of 3 and 7. "

It determines how much weight new trees should have when correcting previous errors. A 'learning_rate' that is too high will learn too quicky and overfit the training data, while a 'learning_rate' that is too low may learn too slowly and require many trees to reach optimal performance, increasing training time. Currently, our 'learning_rate' hyperparameter is set to 0.05. We are going to try setting the value to 0.1 and 0.01 and evaluate which 'learning_rate' value results in the best performance. "

    "Based on the results of our metrics, Model 3 and Model 5 had very close performances in the aboslute metrics. Model 5 had 0.01% better MAPE than Model 3, as well as a slightly better Median Absolute error. Model 3 had a significantly better Mean Absolute Error. Although Model 5 technically beat Model 3 in 2/3 of the absolute metrics, the values were fairly insigificant (4.80% vs. 4.79% MAPE and 3.895 vs. 3.925 Median Absolute Error. In arguably the most important absolute error metric, Mean Absolute Error, Model 3 performed significantly better at a value of 21.429, vs the 21.4675 which Model 5 had. If we then consider the squared metrics, Model 3 performs significantly better than Model 5 in R-Squared, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error. Because of this, Model 3 is our best performing model. \n"

    "### Trading Simulation\n",
    "Now that we have chosen our best model, we want to test how well it actually performs in as close to a real world situation as we can get: a  trading simulation. This will be a good test to see if our model is profitable, unprofitable, or breaks even on average across the 25 stocks we trained it on. Before we do that, we need to build a new DataFrame for the simulation to use. To begin building this DataFrame, we'll include our descriptive columns, 'Symbol' and 'Date', our target variable, 'Close', which will be renamed to 'Actual Price', and two new columns called 'Starting Price' and \"Predicted Price\". 'Starting Price' will just be the 'Actual Price' column shifted 5 days and 'Predicted Price' will be the predicted values from our final best performing model, model 3. Each row will contain the 'Actual Price' (the actual daily closing stock price on that date), the 'Starting Price' (the daily closing stock price from 5 trading days prior), and 'Predicted Price' (the daily closing price predicted for that day).

    "### Performance Measures and Hedging Options\n",
    "To further evaluate our model, we will calculate the bullish and bearish values for mean error, standard deviation of the mean error, and predicted rate of return. These performance evaluations are not only useful to judge the effectiveness of our model and deduce interesting statistical conclusions, but also useful to create a hedge strategy based on the errors of our model. Hedging is a way to reduce risk by making another trade to offset potential losses. For example, if our model predicts a price will go up, we can hedge by taking a small portion of our 'Long' position and put it into a 'Short' position. This way, we limit losses if the trade does not go our way. Since we don't want to accidently give future data to trading simulation, each \"mean\" value is really just a rolling average of the previous 10 values. "

    "### Stock Borrow Fee and Trade Fee\n",
    "In scenarios where our stock is a bearish prediction or we are hedging to the downside to protect losses, we will be shorting stocks, which means we borrow stocks from a broker, sell the shares, then buy them back at a later date (5 trading days later), and return the stocks to the broker. In an ideal situation, we borrow the stocks from the broker, sell them, the price of the stocks decreases, we then buy the stocks back for a lower price, return the stocks to the broker, and profit from the difference. If the stocks increase during this time, we lose profit. In shorting, the period for which you are holding the stocks comes with a fee called a stock borrow fee, which is typically around 3% APY. To add accuracy to our simulation, we calculate how many days we are holding each short trade and incorporate the stock borrow fee in our trade. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, each broker charges a fee to make a trade. The fee is typically around 0.25% per trade. Therefore, calculated into each trade will be a trade fee of 0.25%. "

    "Our simple hedge strategy is going to utilize bullish/bearish mean error, bullish/bearish standard deviation, and predicted rate of return. If the model's prediction is bullish, we add up the values of bullish mean error, bullish standard deviation, and predicted rate of return. If bullish mean error is > 0, it is left out of the hedge and if predicted rate of return is > 0, it is also left out of the hedge. If the model's predicted is bearish, we add up the values just like the bullish prediction. However, if bearish mean error is < 0, it is left out of the hedge and if predicted rate of return is > 0, it is also left out of the hedge. This gives us two new columns 'Bullish Hedge' and 'Bearish Hedge' which we can use in our trading simulation to easily add a hedge to our trades. "

    "### Trading Simulation: Logic\n",
    "We initalize a trading account to $100,000 to start and each trade uses 5% of our portfolio. Each trade is charged a trade fee and if shorting, that  position is charged a stock borrow fee. In order to limit the number of trades, logic has been added to skip days before trading. If num_iteration_skips is > 0, it will loop through the specified number of rows until skip_iteration resets to 0, then will calcualte that trade. This explanation is under the assumption that num_iteration_skips is 0. This trading simulation works by grouping by stock ticker and iterating through each row. Upon each iteration, if the model's predicted price is greater than the starting price (price one week ago), then the trade is bullish. If the model's predicted price is less than the starting price, then the trade is bearish. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the trade is bullish, 5% of current portfolio will be calculated and we find the max number of shares we can buy for the price of the starting value. We then execute that trade by multiplying number of shares we have by starting price, subtracting the total cost of that trade from our trading account value, then, we calculate the end of our position by multiplying our the number of shares we bought by the actual price. We then add the value of that back to our trading account. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the trade is bearish, the same logic will be used to find the number of shares to trade, except this time since we are shorting, we borrow the shares to sell. The value of the short is added to our trading account, then those shares are multiplied by actual price, and that value is subtracted from our trading account. The profit/loss is kept track of, as well as the number of total bullish and bearish trades, the positive bullish/bearish and negative bullish/bearish trades, and the percent gain/loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two simluations will be run, one without our hedging strategy and one with. How hedging works is once a position is established, whether bullish or bearish, if the hedge column for that direction (bull_hedge or bear_hedge) is > 0, that value is multiplied by a risk multiplier (set to 1 by default), the hedge portion is then multiplied by the total trade amount to calculate the hedge portion of the trade. That hedge portion is then subtracted from the main position to get the reduced main trade value and hedge trade value For example, if it is a bullish trade and bull_hedge = 0.07, bull_hedge * risk multipler (3) = 0.21 hedge portion. Bullish trade is now 1.00 - 0.21 = 0.79. In this scenario, 79% of the full trading position enters a bullish position (buys shares), and the remaining 21% enters a bearish position (short sell shares). The goal of this hedge is to try to realistically account for errors in the model, as well as manage risk by limiting loss from trade. "

    "### Summary\n",
    "Using XGBoost, we were able to create a model to predict stock prices 1 week in the future using TA indicators and it had some predictive power in some scenarios, but not enough to consistenly turn a profit. Even though we used a lot of features, which were also multiplied when you added rolling averages and lags, filtering by feature performance and using regularlization techniques helped to reduce the noise and preventing the model from overfitting to the training data. Even though our test metrics were good, up to par with industry standards in terms of algorithmic stock prediction modeling, the results fell short when it came to the trading simulation. Although statistical performance metrics, such as R-Squared, Mean Squared Error, and MAPE are commonplace in model evaluation, they are less interpretable to people outside of the statistical modeling space. However, the results from the trade simulation, such as Average percent returns per year and total profit/loss, is much more understandable and translates those statistical performance metrics into real-life results. Although the XGBoost model was not able to profitably or consistantly predict price, keeping track of its' rolling mean errors, rolling standard deviations, and rolling rate of returns, we were able to adjust for the errors in our model and create a hedging strategy which led to a slightly proftible return on average. Below I dive into limitations of the creation of this model and potential solutions, as well as future actions to enhance the predictive power of this model.\n"

    "  * Data is not updated in real-time, there is a delay. It did not matter as much for our 1 week price prediction, but if we were on a shorter timescale, it would impact performance of model greatly\n",
    "\n",
    "* TA indicators\n",
    "  * Data aggregators, such as Alpha Vantage and Interactive Brokers, provide TA indicators calculated for you\n",
    "  * This saves computational power and time, as well as introducing you to TA indicators you may not have heard of or used before\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solutions\n",
    "* Computational Power\n",
    "  * Use Google Clouds' Compute Engine and access their GPUs\n",
    "  * Rent out space in a data center/cloud center to run your more complex models\n",
    "  * Buy a GPU for your own computer\n",
    "* Delayed Data Importation\n",
    "  * Instead of relying on yfinance, use a data aggregator, like Alpha Vantage or Interactive Brokers, and pay for the tier to gain access to real-time data\n",
    "* TA Indicators\n",
    "  * Many of the stock market data aggregators, like the ones we just mentioned above, also provide pre-calculated TA indicators to import\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Actions\n",
    "* Try other financial/economic features\n",
    "  * Although TA indicators are useful, there are a large number of other features to try using, such as financial ratios for stock valuation, macroeconomic policies like interest rates and inflation, sentiment analysis using X, earnings reports, industry news, and more.\n",
    "  * Most likely, a model will end up being a mix of features above. It will not be every possible feature added to a model, but it will be a couple features from a variety of sources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* More model types\n",
    "  * XGBoost is very popular machine learning algorithm for time series analysis, but when researching, there are a few other algorithms used frequently in time series forcasting\n",
    "  * Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a traditional statistical model that uses past values to predict future values.\n",
    "  * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network that can learn order dependence between items in a sequence\n",
    "    * This model was the most common time series forecasting model I came across\n",
    "  * Prophet is an algorithm created by Facebook that is designed for automatic forecasting of univariate time series analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus on one stock\n",
    "  * Instead of buildling a generalized model using many stocks, try building a predictive model for just one stock\n",
    " \n",
    "* Use classification\n",
    "  * As I was researching for this project, I came across many comments saying that instead of trying to predict an exact price, I should turn it into a classification problem and and predict directionality\n",
    "  * Creating a model to predict whether a stock will go up or down, instead of to an exact price, may be more successful\n",
    "  * It does not have to be binary, it could contain 5 or 6 classifications to identify magnitude of directional move as well\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model trading strategies\n",
    "  * There are many trading strategies commonly talked about in the day/swing trading world, such as Smart Money Concepts (SMC), which is a trading philosphy centered around monitoring the movements of large institutional investors to predict future market movements. It is often using support and resistance lines, TA indicators, and price action.\n",
    "  * ICT (Inner Circle Trader) is another trading strategy, related to SMC, focuses on things like imbalanced liquidity and Fair Value Gaps.\n",
    "  * Beside broad general trading philosophies, simpler specific trading strategies can be modeled and backtested.\n",
